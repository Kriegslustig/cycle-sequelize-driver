# Cycle Sequelize Driver

![CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Kriegslustig/cycle-sequelize-driver.svg?branch=master)

A Cycle.js driver for Sequelize.

**This is not intendet as a high performance reactive ORM for SQL Databases.** I'm building this for one, very specific use-case. Which is SQLite with a single client probably making less than a hundred operations a minute.

So yeah, this project might be an interesting starting point if you wanted to build something more scalable.

## TODO

* Implement tests for findAll
